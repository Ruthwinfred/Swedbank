Swedbank project is a task meant to create a form to be used for loan processing.
Loans are an important part of our financial growth and so alot of people are interested in it. 
So to process a loan, one needs to fill in some data including: official name, ID/passport number, phone number, previous loan history, among others.
This project consists of three main files; Index.html, styles.css, form.html and some javascript part in the form.html file.
The Index.html file is an introductory window, styles.css is used to give the two windows an appealing image and form.html is the form to be filled for loan processing.
